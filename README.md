# SPACE_WARZONE
THIS CODE CONTAINS A GAME WHICH IS INSPIRED AND CONNECTED IT TO A DATABASE
This Python code employs the Pygame library to develop a basic multiplayer space-themed game. Players maneuver their individual spaceships using keyboard controls, aiming to fire bullets at each other. The game interface displays health bars for both spaceships. Background music adds to the gaming experience.

Key Components:

Initialization and Setup: Pygame is initialized, and the display window is created. Colors, fonts, and images (spaceships and background) are loaded.

Functions: The code defines several functions:

draw_window(): Renders the game elements, including spaceships, bullets, and health bars.
draw_winner(): Displays the winner's name in the center of the screen.
yellow_handle_movement(), red_handle_movement(): Manage spaceship movements based on keyboard inputs.
handle_bullets(): Handles bullet movement and collision detection.
Background Music: The game incorporates background music, loaded and played using the mixer module.

Main Game Loop: The core of the game lies in the main() function. Spaceships, bullet lists, and health variables are initialized. The game loop continually checks for user inputs, updates spaceship positions, bullet movements, and health status. It also handles collisions and determines a winner based on health points.

Running the Game: The game starts by calling the main() function and runs until a player wins or the game is exited. After exiting the loop, Pygame is properly closed using pygame.quit().

In summary, this Pygame code creates a basic multiplayer space battle game where players control spaceships, shoot bullets, and aim to deplete their opponent's health. The game loop ensures continuous interaction and visual updates, while functions manage key aspects of the gameplay, resulting in an engaging and entertaining gaming experience.
